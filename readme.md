# Tic-Tac-Toe ML/AI class project

This project is a graduation work for a one year data science course organized by Warsaw University / Faculty of Economics.

The objective is to implement few ML/AI algorithms capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe. The code will be in python and I want to refrain from using high level libraries such as SciKit-Learn. The reason is, that I believe that implementing machine learning algorithms, even in most simple cases such as the game of tic-tac-toe, is the best wat to gain deep insight and experience in data science. Furthere more I also aim at improving my programming abilities. Aside from the code, a parallel document describing the theoretical background will be contrived.

Do not expect anything new here. This is a class project and I am far from proefessional. Nevertheless, if your are a tic-tac-toe enthusiast or you just feel like leaving any comments, suggestion for improvement etc., I will be honestly thankfull.
